title: Messenger bags are bad
category: Personal Rants

_(Inspired by an aching right leg.)_

Scout teams often assume that weight of a carry should not exceed a rounded down one-tenth of your body mass. For person who weights 56 kilograms (123 pounds) like me, it means I can have around 5 kilos (or 11 pounds) worth of gear on me.

My current lineup of equipment is mostly overwhelmed by rMBP 13 inch. and its charger, yet with additional accessories total weight can sum up to total of  5 kg — doesn’t look that bad, huh?

But this again works only with the assumption you get it in a backpack or a vest so that load is perfectly balanced.

Messenger bags are not an option for solving the load issue.

This is why I said goodbye to my Half Mass messenger bag by Patagonia. It worked perfectly for over two years and still looks good as new – but I know my back and legs are going to appreciate my decision.

Think about what you carry and how.

_(This is extra important if you carry additional gym equipment with you.)_
