title: UUIDs in Rails generators

You want to use UUID instead of incrementals as your primary keys – because it's a [good idea](http://andrzejonsoftware.blogspot.com/2013/12/decentralise-id-generation.html) – but Rails annoys you by still enerating migration files with integers?

Then add this to configuration:

~~~ ruby
Rails.application.config.active_record.primary_key = :uuid
~~~
