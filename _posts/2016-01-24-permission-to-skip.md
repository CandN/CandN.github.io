Yesterday I didn't post anything. But if you follow me on Facebook, you probably know I wanted to write every single day. Have I failed then?

Laughing answer is – yes. Real answer is – no.

Far too often we create schedules in our heads which are impossible to meet. It's not a bad thing. I wanted a concise rule when to post and _"every day"_ looked neat.

Problem is when we start to use it as an excuse. By some logic I should give up blogging since I failed, right? Imaginary deadlines in our minds somehow become more important than actual results. That happens all the time.

Don't believe me?

Think about when you got demotivated because you skipped one day of training due to being sick when you promised yourself to workout every day. When you were on a diet and ate that one slice of pizza on Friday. Many people just give up at that very moment: _my imaginary plan won't be PERFECT now and so there's no reason to continue_ they think.

And they quit.

Don't be a quitter.

There are no 100% complete exercise plans. And yes, you should set one day a week in your diet schedule to eat an unhealthy meal if other option is you qutting your diet whatsoever. And no, you shouldn't probably post after a visit to a doctor when your eyes hurt.

Be straight with yourself. But also be fair.

That's what makes an adult person.
