title: My plan for wroclove.rb, 2016 edition
category: Technical Notes
---
[wroclove.rb](http://www.wrocloverb.com/) is in my opinion the best Ruby conference held in Poland from what I heard. I'm a little bit ashamed to admit this is the first time I'm actually going to take part in it.

Anyhow, here you will find a breakdown of the schedule, done mostly for benefit of me, to better manage my time and expectations during the event.

## Rules

But first some conference rules.

And I'm not talking about code of conduct, no.

I'm talking about rules I force on myself to enjoy the trip. Here they are, so few since that's the best way to ensure I'll remember – and more importantly – follow them.

1. Get up early and do sight-seeing.
2. No alcohol and no partying through the night.
3. Use laptop in OFFLINE mode and only for notes (except workshops).

Those should help.

Now for the actual schedule.

## Friday

- `11am/5:00pm` React, Redux and Rails workshops – so many R's, I know. I'm excited mostly because my familiarity with React is limited to theoretical knowledge of its ideas. I'll be so happy to code in it as it's one of the few JavaScript libraries I can swallow. It fits as well with my plans for the second quarter of 2016 self-development – but that's for another post.

- `5pm/5:30pm` Opal.rb – quite interesting. I'm really unsure how much it's ready for production use and hope to hear more.

- `6pm/6:30pm` next Andrzej's talk entitled _from legacy to DDD_ – not sure what's that about but he often has some good insights into software development strategies.

- `7pm/8pm` lightning talks – that's totally random but I expect nice input from a lot of folks.

## Saturday

- `11am/11:30am` and _the R language_ talk – I know, another _R_, right? I'm not about to diminish any language importance, will still attend this talk, but it does not have place in my incoming plans ;-)

- `12pm/12:30pm` is _the SAGA pattern_ time – I will be honest again: no idea what this pattern is. I could Google it right now but I prefer a surprise.

- `2:30pm/3:30pm` is something... weird: the _Ruby and code editors_ panel/fight – and maybe that's because I'm a bitter vet of editor wars who then subscribed into thinking [you should try them all]() – and as such I have no interest in debating editors. Ugh.

- `4pm/4:30pm` NixOS – it's funny that at the Ruby conference the talk I'm waiting the most for is about Linux with declarative system of packages much more alike Haskell than any type of dynamic programming language.

- `5pm/5:30pm` _ROS: ecosystem for things_ – no idea what it is. That's a result of no description on the conference schedule.

- `6pm/7pm` lightning talks again;

## Sunday

- `11am/11:30am` is for Oskar from [TRUG](http://trug.pl) and his expierence _1 year with ROM on production_ – from our local group meetings I might be able to estimate the content of his talk but still it should be fun to listen about other approach than Rails.

- `12pm/12:30pm` is for _consumer-driven contracts in Rails_ and again, I'm not sure what this talk will be about; sure, I know the `contracts` gem but I guess that's not it.

_[Unofrtunetly, this is a point at which we will leave the conference and head back home. I'm not very happy about it but life has priorities and dues to be done. Goodbye, Wrocław!]_

- `4pm/4:30pm` _lessons of Liskov_ – this title sounds awesome but nothing more I can tell about it.

- `5pm/5:30pm` will be all about dealing with payments which is something I was doing for the last 2 years, as my projects where always heavily-based around payments.

- `6pm/7pm` lightning talks again

And that would be all.

I may write a summary after the conference. The thing is, I usually enjoy playing the Sherlock Holmes and trying to figure out what will happen instead of writing down history. But who knows.

Have a great conference – _me_.
