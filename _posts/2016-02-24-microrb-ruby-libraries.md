title: micro.rb – small and focused Ruby gems
category: Technical Notes

[micro.rb](http://microrb.com/) is an archive of small, concise Ruby gems.

There are gems out there with bigger number of dependiencies than all those micro gems combined. If you're a fan of code seperation, know what [SRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) stands for and enjoy well-engineered libraries, you must take a look at them.

Few of my favorites I used, either for work or for fun only:

- `adamantium` for creating immutable objects
- `ast` for when you need to interact with the syntax tree
- `envied` if you're using ENV vars and want to keep them in line
- `virtus` for when you need a rehab from `ActiveRecord` models

Seriously – check it out.
